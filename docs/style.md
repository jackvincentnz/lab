# Style

## Commit style

Commit style is enforced with [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) on commit.

> commitlint helps your team adhering to a commit convention. By supporting npm-installed configurations it makes sharing of commit conventions easy.

This makes the commit history nice and clean, increasing the ability to quickly determine what has happened.

Commits should follow the [conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style. See [What is commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint) for more information.

## Code style

### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used to format multiple source files on commit, mostly in the front end eco-system. This ensures a consistent, opinionated style.

What:

> - An opinionated code formatter
> - Supports many languages
> - Integrates with most editors
> - Has few options

Why:

> - You press save and code is formatted
> - No need to discuss style in code review
> - Saves you time and energy

See [Why prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/why-prettier.html) for more information.
